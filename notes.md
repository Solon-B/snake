It looks like you've provided details about the format, rules, and content coverage of the final exam for your JavaScript instruction class. Let's break down the key points:

Format:

The final exam is in multiple-choice format.
It will be available online on Canvas during specific open dates.
There is no time limit for the exam, but the average time to complete it is expected to be less than 60 minutes.
Submission Rules:

The exam must be taken during the specified open dates.
No late submissions are allowed.
Resource Allowance:

You are allowed to view any notes that you have placed in your Startup repository notes.md file during the test.
No other external notes, websites, content, programs, utilities, tools, or assistance from other people are allowed or referenced.
Content Coverage:

The exam will cover topics from the end of the JavaScript instruction until the end of the class.
The focus is on general knowledge of primary topics, including basic syntax and usage of languages and protocols such as HTTP, HTTP requests, web services, database services, authorization services, WebSocket, web application frameworks, and web security.
Preparation Recommendation:

It is highly suggested that you attend or view the class review session to prepare for the exam.
In summary, the exam aims to assess your understanding of key concepts in web development and related technologies. Make sure to review the relevant material, use your class notes, and attend the review session to enhance your preparedness for the final exam. Good luck!


Ports:
HTTP: Port 80
HTTPS: Port 443
SSH: Port 22
HTTP Status Codes:
300 Range: Indicates redirection.
400 Range: Indicates client errors (e.g., 404 Not Found).
500 Range: Indicates server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
HTTP Header Content-Type:
Allows you to specify the media type of the resource. It tells the browser how to interpret the response content. For example, it can be set to application/json for JSON data.
Cookie Attributes:
Domain: Specifies the domain to which the cookie belongs.
Path: Defines the URL path to which the cookie is applicable.
SameSite: Controls whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests.
HTTPOnly: Prevents client-side access to the cookie through JavaScript.
Express Middleware:
Without the provided middleware code, it's challenging to determine the specific console.log output for an HTTP GET request with a URL path of /foo/bar. It would depend on the middleware configurations and the order of execution.
MongoDB Query:
{ cost: { $gt: 10 }, name: /fran.*/ } will select all documents where the cost is greater than 10 and the name matches the regular expression /fran.*/.
Password Storage:
Hash passwords using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Never store plain-text passwords.
WebSocket Protocol:
WebSocket is used for full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It allows real-time data transfer.
JSX and Curly Braces:
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, used with React.
Curly braces in JSX are used for embedding dynamic expressions. For example, {props.name} inserts the value of the name prop into the rendered output.
React Components:
First Component (Welcome and App): Renders a greeting with a specified name.
Second Component (Numbers): Renders an unordered list of numbers.
Third Component (Example): Demonstrates the usage of React Hooks (useState) to manage state.
React Hooks:
React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and other React features.
useEffect hook is used for side effects in functional components.
React Router (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route):
Configures client-side routing in a React application using React Router.
npm in Web Development:
npm (Node Package Manager) is used for package management in Node.js projects.
It allows you to install, share, and manage project dependencies.
package.json in npm Project:
package.json is a metadata file in a npm project.
It includes project details, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.
Fetch Function:
fetch is a web API for making HTTP requests.
It is used to retrieve resources or make requests to APIs.
Node.js:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
It is commonly used for server-side development.
Vite:
Vite is a development server and build tool for modern web development.
It focuses on fast development and optimized production builds.
Remember that some answers might depend on specific context or configurations in your environment.

Port Numbers:
HTTP uses port 80.
HTTPS uses port 443.
SSH (Secure Shell) uses port 22.
HTTP Status Codes:
300 Range: Redirection.
400 Range: Client errors (e.g., 404 for Not Found).
500 Range: Server errors (e.g., 500 for Internal Server Error).
HTTP Header Content-Type:
The Content-Type HTTP header specifies the media type of the resource. It allows the server to indicate the type of data in the response.
Cookie Attributes:
Domain: Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.
Path: Limits the cookie to a specific path on the server.
SameSite: Defines when a cookie should be sent with cross-origin requests.
HTTPOnly: Prevents client-side access to the cookie through JavaScript.
Express Middleware:
The provided Express middleware is not given. Without it, it's impossible to determine the console.log output.
Express Service Code:
The JavaScript fetch will return a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request.
MongoDB Query:
The query selects all documents where the cost is greater than 10 and the name matches the regular expression /fran.*/.
Password Storage:
Passwords should be securely hashed using strong, adaptive hash functions (e.g., bcrypt) and should be salted.
WebSocket Protocol:
WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. They are commonly used for real-time applications.
JSX and Curly Braces:
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React. Curly braces in JSX are used to embed dynamic expressions or JavaScript code.
React Component with ReactDOM:
The React component will render three <h1> elements, each saying "Hello" to the specified names.
React Numbers Component:
The React component will generate an unordered list (<ul>) containing list items (<li>) for each number in the array.
React useState Hook:
The useState hook is used to add state variables to functional components in React. In this example, it tracks a count state and updates it on button click.
React Hooks:
React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to have state and lifecycle features.
useEffect Hook:
The useEffect hook is used for side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
React Routes (BrowserRouter):
This code sets up routes using React Router. It defines routes for the root, blogs, and contact pages, with a wildcard route for unmatched paths.
npm in Web Development:
npm (Node Package Manager) is used in web development to manage project dependencies, install packages, and run scripts.
package.json in npm Project:
package.json is a configuration file that holds metadata and dependencies information for an npm package or project.
fetch Function:
The fetch function is used to make network requests (e.g., HTTP requests) and returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request.
Node.js:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side.
Vite:
Vite is a build tool for modern web development. It is designed to be fast and efficient, providing a development server and optimized production builds for web applications.
