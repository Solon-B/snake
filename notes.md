Ports:
HTTP: Port 80
HTTPS: Port 443
SSH: Port 22
HTTP Status Codes:
300 Range: Indicates redirection.
400 Range: Indicates client errors (e.g., 404 Not Found).
500 Range: Indicates server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
HTTP Header Content-Type:
Allows you to specify the media type of the resource. It tells the browser how to interpret the response content. For example, it can be set to application/json for JSON data.
Cookie Attributes:
Domain: Specifies the domain to which the cookie belongs.
Path: Defines the URL path to which the cookie is applicable.
SameSite: Controls whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests.
HTTPOnly: Prevents client-side access to the cookie through JavaScript.
Express Middleware:
Without the provided middleware code, it's challenging to determine the specific console.log output for an HTTP GET request with a URL path of /foo/bar. It would depend on the middleware configurations and the order of execution.
MongoDB Query:
{ cost: { $gt: 10 }, name: /fran.*/ } will select all documents where the cost is greater than 10 and the name matches the regular expression /fran.*/.
Password Storage:
Hash passwords using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Never store plain-text passwords.
WebSocket Protocol:
WebSocket is used for full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It allows real-time data transfer.
JSX and Curly Braces:
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, used with React.
Curly braces in JSX are used for embedding dynamic expressions. For example, {props.name} inserts the value of the name prop into the rendered output.
React Components:
First Component (Welcome and App): Renders a greeting with a specified name.
Second Component (Numbers): Renders an unordered list of numbers.
Third Component (Example): Demonstrates the usage of React Hooks (useState) to manage state.
React Hooks:
React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and other React features.
useEffect hook is used for side effects in functional components.
React Router (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route):
Configures client-side routing in a React application using React Router.
npm in Web Development:
npm (Node Package Manager) is used for package management in Node.js projects.
It allows you to install, share, and manage project dependencies.
package.json in npm Project:
package.json is a metadata file in a npm project.
It includes project details, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.
Fetch Function:
fetch is a web API for making HTTP requests.
It is used to retrieve resources or make requests to APIs.
Node.js:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
It is commonly used for server-side development.
Vite:
Vite is a development server and build tool for modern web development.
It focuses on fast development and optimized production builds.
Remember that some answers might depend on specific context or configurations in your environment.
